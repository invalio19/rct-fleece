# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2019-04-08

### Added

- Build up a list of rides and get the maximum price you can charge for them—or the 'good value' price—based on its ratings.
- Automatic duplicate ride type detection (having more than one ride of the same type decreases its value by about 25%).
- Data is auto-saved to the browser whenever any details are changed, and persists even when the page is closed.
- Compatible with RCT2, RCT Classic and OpenRCT2.
- Manually sort the order of rides.
- Designed to work well on mobile.
